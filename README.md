Hypersistence
=============

<h2>Atention!</h2>
This framework is being developed!
<strong>I recomend to use the new version (<a href="https://github.com/mateusfornari/hypersistence-alpha">Hypersistence2.0</a>)!</strong>

PHP Object Oriented persistence framework.

This is a simple persistence framework for PHP classes.
No installation is required. Just include and extend the Hypersistence class.

You can find an example at <a href="https://github.com/mateusfornari/Hypersistence/wiki/Introduction">Introduction</a>.

I will write complete documentation as soon as I can!
