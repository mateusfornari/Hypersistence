Hypersistence
=============

PHP Object Oriented persistence framework.

This is a simple persistence framework for PHP classes.
No installation is required. Just include and extend the Hypersistence class.

You can find an example at <a href="https://github.com/mateusfornari/Hypersistence/wiki/Introduction">Introduction</a>.

I will write complete documentation as soon as I can!
